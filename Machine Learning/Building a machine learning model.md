# Building a machine learning model
___

Building a machine learning model involves several stages of cleaning and analysis. The steps needed often to build a machine learning model are the following.

1. Data Gathering
2. Data Transformation
3. Data Cleaning
4. Exploratory Data Analysis
5. Building a predictive model
6. Communicating the model
7. Deploying the results

Each of the following tasks are described in detail below.

* **Data Gathering**

	- In this stage, based on the problem being tackled, necessary data has to be collected. It could be data provided by the client or publicly available data. 
	- Identifying the correct type of data to be collected is an important step. For example, when you are dealing with a problem where a particular time period is of significant importance, collect data from these times to make sure the data is complete and any trends are n't missing from the data.
	- Very often, the data collected will be from different providers/sources. Each of them may follow a different format/structure and hence the next step is going to be a crucial step in such cases which is Data Transformation.
